Hello Swift Community. I started a conversation about this on the [Evolution|Proposals](https://forums.swift.org/t/typed-throw-functions/38860/) Forum and some people found interesting that might be worth to write a pitch about it.

Typed `throws`
Proposal: SE-NNNNN
Authors: @minuscorp
Review Manager: TBD
Status: Proposed

# Introduction

Swift Error handling system seems lacking of the other features that the Swift language has: a type system. Having typed thrown errors allow users to make a more faine-grained error handling and a more safety when facing error handling procedures.


# Motivation


# Source compatibility
This change is purely additive and should not affect source compatibility.

# Effect on ABI stability
No known effect.

# Effect on API resilience
No known effect.
